# Netflix Subscription Prediction

## Overview

Welcome to the Netflix Subscription Prediction project! In this project, we leverage data science and machine learning techniques to forecast whether a user is likely to subscribe to Netflix. Our focus is not just on building accurate predictions but also on presenting the results in a user-friendly and understandable way.

**Key Features:**

1. **ARIMA Model**: We've employed the powerful ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to make predictions. ARIMA is well-suited for time series data, making it an ideal choice for forecasting Netflix subscription trends.

2. **Interactive Visualizations**: We believe that data should be accessible to everyone, so we've incorporated interactive graphs that are easy for users of all levels to understand. You can hover over these graphs to get more information and insights.

3. **10-Period Forecast**: Our model provides forecasts for the next 10 periods based on the dataset. This helps Netflix and stakeholders plan for the future and make data-driven decisions . And also you can customize the time periods based on your requirement it will give the prediction for your input.

## How It Works

1. **Data Analysis**: We start by thoroughly analyzing the dataset, exploring factors that might influence Netflix subscriptions. This includes historical subscription data, user demographics, viewing habits, and more.

2. **ARIMA Modeling**: The heart of our prediction lies in the ARIMA model. It takes into account past subscription trends and patterns to forecast future subscription numbers.

3. **Interactive Visualization**: We've created interactive graphs that allow users to hover over data points and see specific details. This user-friendly approach makes it easy for anyone to grasp the insights.

4. **Forecasting**: Our model generates forecasts for the next 10 periods, helping Netflix plan marketing campaigns, content releases, and other strategies.

## Why It Matters

Predicting subscription trends is crucial for Netflix's success. With accurate forecasts, Netflix can:

- Tailor content recommendations to potential subscribers.
- Optimize advertising campaigns.
- Allocate resources effectively.
- Ensure a seamless user experience by anticipating demand.
